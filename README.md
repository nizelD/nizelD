# Hello ðŸ‘‹

## Just... ðŸ‘€
"You know, I don't believe in good or bad situations. If I had to sum up my life with you today, I'd say it's first and foremost a series of encounters. People who reached out to me, perhaps at a time when I couldn't, when I was home alone. And it's strange to think that chance encounters forge a destiny... Because when you've got a taste for things, when you've got a taste for things well done, for beautiful gestures, sometimes you don't find the person opposite, I'd say, the mirror that helps you move forward. So that's not my case, as I was saying, because on the contrary, I've been able to; and I say thank you to life, I say thank you to it, I sing life, I dance life... I'm all about love! And finally, when people say to me "But how do you manage to have this humanity?", I answer them very simply that it's this taste for love, this taste that has driven me today to undertake mechanical engineering... but tomorrow, who knows? Perhaps simply to put myself at the service of the community, to make the gift, the gift of self."
